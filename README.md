# KneeProsthetic

Passive and powered leg prostheses are expensive and require access to specific equipment and technology, making them very inaccessible. Our objective is to build an open source powered prosthesis that is lightweight, inexpensive, and has a functional controller to be a foundation for striving engineers.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the preliminary code to manually control your powered prosthesis through both wired and wireless communication. 

### Prerequisites

* Arduino - latest edition
* Teensyduino - latest edition
* Python 2.7

* Raspberry Pi Zero W (x2 for wireless communication)
* Teensy 4.0

### Installing

* [Teensyduino Download Link](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
* [Arduino Download Link](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
